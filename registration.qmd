In keeping with the spirit of Unconferences, participation is completely free.
We therefore encourage anyone, with the means to do so, to make a donation to
the [Black Trowel Collective](https://blacktrowelcollective.wordpress.com/microgrants/).

From the Black Trowel Collective:

> We are a collective of archaeologists committed to the active support of
archaeology students from working-class and historically looted communities
who are both regularly excluded by traditional scholarship and academic programs,
or who require more economic support than those resources cover.


## Workshop hosts

**Registration for workshop hosts will open soon**

We welcome proposed workshops on any topic related to Open Science practices (e.g.,
FAIR data, open source tools, etc). We will be able to accommodate 3-4 workshops
of 45 or 90 mins in length. If more workshop topics are proposed than we can accommodate,
participants can indicate their preferred topics during registration and the 3-4 most
popular topics will be given at the Unconference.


## Presenters

**Registration for presenters will open 21st of July**

We welcome all presentations on the topic of Open Science in Archaeology.
Topics can range from Open Science
success stories (open research and education), research related to open science,
useful tools (R and python packages), and more. The sky is the limit! (figuratively speaking;
topics should ideally be related to Open Science and/or archaeology)
Descriptions will not be published, so we welcome relevant presentations that have already
been presented at other venues; please do re-use previous presentations!


## General

**General registration will open 21st of July**
